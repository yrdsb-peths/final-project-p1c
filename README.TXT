VERSION or DATE: Jan 21, 2022
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Press Play Button on greenfoot
AUTHORS: Aninda Saha, Conrad Mo
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Balloon Defence 3 is a top down shooter style game. The player
is a money, and the goal is to survive as many waves of enemies as possible. The enemies,
which are multicoloured balloons with different stats, will keep following the player 
until they lose of all their health. There are three unique worlds with differing difficulty:
the Grasslands (world 1), the Desert (world 2), and the Graveyard (world 3). As you 
defeat the balloons, you get gold, which allows you to get epic upgrades for your
monkey to further your chances of lasting against the balloons. Try your hardest to 
get a new high score!
